# Cursor IDE Clone

This is a simplified clone of the Cursor IDE interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the look and feel of the Cursor IDE, a modern code editor with AI capabilities.

## Features

- Modern VS Code-like UI similar to Cursor IDE
- Syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown
- File explorer with folder structure
- Tab management
- AI assistant panel
- Status bar
- Line numbers

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Explore the interface:
   - Click on files in the explorer to open them
   - Click on tabs to switch between open files
   - Click the AI icon in the sidebar to open the AI assistant panel
   - Type messages to the AI assistant and click send (or press Enter)

## Implementation Details

- Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses highlight.js for syntax highlighting
- Uses Font Awesome for icons
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

## Limitations

This is a frontend-only clone focused on the UI. It doesn't include:
- Actual code editing functionality (it's display-only)
- Real AI capabilities (responses are pre-defined)
- File system integration
- Terminal functionality
- Git integration

## Future Improvements

- Add actual code editing capabilities
- Implement a more realistic AI assistant
- Add more IDE features like search, replace, etc.
- Add theme switching
- Implement settings panel
